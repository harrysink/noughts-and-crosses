# noughts&crosses

noughts&crosses is my implementation of our childhood game in unforgettable memory, x & o.

It is a React project bootstrapped with Vite, and written in Typescript.

It is still subject to upgrades and contributions from fellow developers, in other words, its open-source.

So feel free to submit your pull requests, i'll be delighted to see em'!

In the meantime, enjoy!
